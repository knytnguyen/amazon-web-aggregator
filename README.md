# Project Description
This project is the Python web scraping program that I created in Jupyter Notebook to extract the data of products off of the Amazon website and convert that data into a .csv file type and database. 

This project leverages the Beautiful Soup library and other Python libraries to extract and utilize underlying HTML code on Amazon's interface to compile the data of all of the products under a specific search term. The data extracted includes the product's title, price, savings percentage, average ratings, review count, and the availability of the product which are then inputted into a .csv file for ease of viewing and analysis.

## Programming Languages and Libraries:
* Python
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
